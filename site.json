If you qualify for this program, you may only be liable for the tax liabilities and interest. I can guide you through the process, which includes the completion of three years of required returns, the submission of six FBARs (Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts, FinCen 114) and 14653 statement.zzz",
